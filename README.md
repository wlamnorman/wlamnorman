- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wlamnorman
- ðŸ‘€ I hold a master's degree in mathematics and have since 2022 turned a data scientist. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a quantitative analyst at Abios Gaming AB. In my spare time I use github for exploring concepts that I read about in books, articles or come up with myself.
